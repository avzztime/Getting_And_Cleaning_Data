# Getting_And_Cleaning_Data

## Background

There are 2 files that can be referenced to understand the scope,methodology and data used in this project. Start with the CodeBook to get a high level understanding of the data sources, transformations and output. The actual code to complete the steps referenced in the CodeBook can be found in the run_analysis.R script.

The Codebook also has links to the orginal data source for an in-depth description of the data and the experiment that was conducted to collect the data used in this project.
